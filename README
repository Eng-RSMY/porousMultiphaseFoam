**************************************************************************

* General Informations : 


- This toolbox is compatible with OpenFOAM 2.2 and later (and foam-extend 3.0 and later).

- This toolbox needs only a standard OpenFOAM installation (see www.openfoam.org)

- Please cite the related paper (Horgue et al. 2014) if you are using this toolbox.

- Read the COPYING_OPENFOAM file for information about OpenFOAM and this toolbox Copyrights.

* Installation instructions : 


- First, source the OpenFOAM configuration file, i.e. (example for ubuntu version) : 
   source /opt/openfoam2xx/etc/bashrc

- then in the "porousMultiphaseFoam" directory, run :

	./Allwmake

  to install the package.

- Dynamic libraries, "libporousBoundaryConditions.so" and "libporousModels.so"
  are compiled in the standard OpenFOAM user directory : $FOAM_USER_LIBBIN;

- The executable solver "impesFoam" is placed in the standard OpenFOAM user
  directory $FOAM_USER_APPBIN.

- Each tutorial directory contains "run" and "clean" files to test installation
  and validate the solver.

- To remove temporary files AND dynamic librairies AND executables, run :

	./Allwclean


* Note for versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x :

- The Coats CFL condition (in CoatsNo.H) use the "delta()" function from the mesh
  structure that is not available in old versions. Consequently, you have
  to remove this condition or compute manually the delta to use this toolbox for
  old versions. 

- The "sample" function has changed and now 1D profiles are in the directory
  "postProcessing/sets" and not anymore in "sets". 
  To plot 1D profiles in the Buckley-Leverett tutorials, after running the
  simulation, run :

     mkdir postProcessing
     mv sets postProcessing/
     gnuplot plot_caseGravity.gp (or plot_caseNoGravity.gp)

impesFoam

IMPES method solving two-phase flow in porous media with several multiphase 
models available in the provided libraries. Permeability field is isotropic
and can be heterogeneous (K is a volScalarField).

****************************************************************************

anisoImpesFoam

IMPES method solving two-phase flow in porous media with several multiphase 
models available in the provided libraries. Permeability field is anisotropic
and can be heterogeneous (K is a volTensorField).

****************************************************************************

groundwaterFoam

Picard's method used to solve two-phase flow in porous media neglecting the 
pressure gradient in the non-wetting phase (Richards' equation). Several 
multiphase models from the literature are available in the provided libraries.
Permeability field is isotropic and can be heterogeneous (K is a volScalarField).

****************************************************************************

porousModels 

library containing several models for porous multiphase flows :

- phase models : incompressible  
- relative permeabilities : Brooks and Corey, Van Genuchten
- capillary pressure : Brooks and Corey, Van Genuchten, linear

*******************************************************************************

porousBoundaryConditions 

New boundary conditions necessary to impose phase velocities:
    - 'darcyGradPressure' for impesFoam simulations
    - 'darcyGradPressureAniso' for anisoImpesFoam simulations

*******************************************************************************

tutorials

Containing validation cases : 

- Buckley-Leverett for "kr" models.
- Capillary pressure for "pc" models.
- Injection-extraction of water in a storage (iso- and anisotropic simulations)
